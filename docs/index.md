# DejaVu

> DejaVu is a platform that allows journalists
to compare images, determine which images
they consider to be the originals, and communicate
these findings with other journalists within their
organization.

# Why is it useful?

> A large impact of the growth of technology in the last
decade has been the revolution of the news industry.
With a simple Google search, an individual can now
have access to an endless number of news sources and
articles at their fingertips. With the change from
physical newspapers to online content distributions,
journalists are faced with the responsibility of choosing
from the vast information landscape of the Internet on
what they believe is most important to report. Along
with this responsibility, journalists are also burdened
with the task of verifying what content they believe to
be true and what they believe to be fake news. More
specifically, a large issue faced by journalists is
determining which images may have been manipulated
or taken out of their original context or, more broadly
put, identifying visual misinformation in order to
prevent the spreading of fake news.

# What is Visual Misinformation?

> Visual misinformation is defined as an image that is
misleading, manipulated, or fabricated, or sharing of
genuine content outside of context.
