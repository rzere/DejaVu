## What is DejaVu?

DejaVu is a Google Chrome extension that allows journalists to compare images, determine which images
they consider to be the originals, and communicate these findings with other journalists within their organization.

## Steps to install:

2. Run the command `json-server --watch db.json` to initialize json server.
3. To install DejaVu, upload this directory to your `chrome://extensions/` by toggling developer mode and selecting "Load unpacked".
